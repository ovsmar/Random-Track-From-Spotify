            <p>*Sometimes, when you click the 'Get Random 30sec Track From Spotify' button, the selected track may not
                play. This could be because the track does not have a preview available on Spotify, or because of
                regional restrictions that prevent the preview from playing in your location. Also, keep in mind that
                this tool relies on a random selection of tracks from a specific playlist, so it is possible that some
                of the tracks may not be available in your country or region. We apologize for any inconvenience and
                suggest that you try clicking the button again to get a different track.*</p>
